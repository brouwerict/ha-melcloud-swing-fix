# 🎨 MELCloud Icon Solutions Guide

## The Problem
Custom integrations in Home Assistant 2025.8.1+ cannot display custom icons without proper registration. Our previous JavaScript approaches don't work with modern HA security policies.

## ✅ **3 Working Solutions**

- ✅ **Complete coverage** - all UI elements
- ✅ **No user configuration** required

**Cons**:
